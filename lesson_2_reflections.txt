What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Provides a temporary storage area for items to be "staged" prior to a commit. It provides some flexibility.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Sh*t. I don't know.
