How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped pinpoint the locations of the file differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Provide visibilty to a files evolution over time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    More control.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because that functionality is more relevant to programming.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Track changes within the program.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you know you can easily evert back to a previously working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Try my hand at source control management using Git for a sample project.
